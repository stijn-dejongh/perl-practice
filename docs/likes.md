# Stuff I like

A quick-fire list of things I like about Perl, and my rationale for each. The goal is to revisit this in a while and see if I still agree with myself.

## CPAN 

The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a massive repository of Perl modules and libraries. It’s like a treasure trove of reusable code that can save you time and effort. I love the fact that I can find a module for almost anything I need, and it’s often well-documented and maintained. This makes it easy to leverage existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.

> **WARNING:** I need to be careful not to over-rely on libraries to solve problems. The first step should always be to understand what I am trying to do, and see if there is a core language feature/idiom that allows me to do so.

## Maturity / History

Perl has been around longer than I have, and has a lot of history behind it. This means that there are a lot of resources available for learning and troubleshooting. It also means that there are a lot of people who have been using Perl for a long time, and have a lot of experience with it. I should be able to learn from their experience, and avoid some of the pitfalls that they have encountered.

## Module Structure and Namespaces

I like the way that Perl modules are structured, with a clear separation between the module name and the file name. This makes it easy to find the code that I am looking for. The notation `SCOPE::MODULE::ITEM` is clear and easy to read. And I think the use of semi-colons to separate the different parts of the module name looks cool.
