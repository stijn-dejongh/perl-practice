# General Reflections 

This document is a collection of reflections on my experience with Perl while working with it both professionally and personally. It serves to document my thoughts, feeling, and experiences as I explore the __"Way of Perl"__ and try to make it fit my existing toolbox.

These reflections are not meant to be comprehensive, nor highly structured. They are a way of capturing snapshots of my experience, and I hope to revisit them in the future to see how my perspective has changed.

## üåÄ Perl: Retrospective Impressions After a Few Weeks

I‚Äôve come to appreciate Perl far more than I expected to.

The real shift happened when I:
- Started using `Params::Validate` to define clean function contracts
- Understood the subtle elegance of Perl‚Äôs **multiplicity model** ‚Äî where many constructs sensibly handle __‚Äúnone, one, or many‚Äù__ without blowing up
- Learned to treat CPAN not as a relic, but as a well-curated, powerful ecosystem with far less cruft than its flashier cousins (`npm`, `pip`)

Once I crossed that threshold, I found myself reaching for Perl in the same places I used to reach for Python or shell:
- Small automation scripts
- Quick data transformation or parsing
- Config-driven batch jobs

But Perl feels **more lightweight than Python**, and more **shapable than shell**. I like that I can express logic in clear blocks -- **with explicit braces** instead of relying on invisible indentation rules. There's something grounding about that.


### ‚öôÔ∏è A Working Mental Model for Perl Programs

As I started to write more scripts, a kind of structure emerged naturally:

- **Simple tasks** ‚Üí plain scripts, written directly, with minimal ceremony
- **Moderately complex programs** ‚Üí split into small modules:
    - One for domain logic (with tests)
    - One for "plumbing" (CLI, file I/O, coordination)
- **Programs that interact with other systems** ‚Üí (still speculative) but I‚Äôd expect to:
    - Lean heavily on **CPAN for parsing, HTTP, and system tools**
    - Use **modular layering** to keep the program composable

It‚Äôs a structure I‚Äôve used in other ecosystems ‚Äî it just took me a bit to realize that Perl *wants* you to modularize, even if the language doesn‚Äôt force it.


### üßµ Other Things That Helped

- **Named arguments** made my code much more readable and less error-prone. I avoid unpacking `@_` directly, and always pass a hashref or named list -- it makes maintenance and testing feel sane.
- I‚Äôve come to enjoy how Perl handles **text blocks and interpolation**. The [here-doc](https://perlmaven.com/here-documents) syntax is powerful but simple, and scalar interpolation Just Works ‚Äî `$var` or `${name}` inside double quotes is ergonomic and predictable.
- I‚Äôve always been a sucker for regular expressions, and seeing them treated as **first-class tools** is refreshing. Pattern matching in Perl isn‚Äôt an afterthought -- it‚Äôs a core expressive mechanism.
- The implicit variables (`$_`, `@_`, `$!`) feel cryptic at first, but once you lean into them, they offer a kind of expressive terseness that works surprisingly well in short scripts and filters.
- I also spent some time with Perl‚Äôs **POD documentation system**, and I really like the **intent** behind it. The ability to impose your own structure -- with sections and subsections -- is a nice parallel to Markdown or LaTeX, especially with bits of code woven in between.  
  That said, I **truly dislike** its verbosity and whitespace quirks. It‚Äôs a great idea, and it works well enough -- but it also feels like something that was ahead of its time‚Ä¶ and then left behind by time. Solid bones, rough edges.

### üß† Final Reflection

Perl has started to feel less like a quirky survival tool, and more like a *minimalist multitool*: compact, sharp, and surprisingly refined if you know how to hold it.

Yes -- I still reach for more specialized tools for more complex tasks (Java, Angular, Kotlin...), just like I wouldn‚Äôt build a shed with a Swiss army knife. But when I need to open a box, tighten a screw, or slice some twine? **Good old Perl is right there in my pocket.**

The main trade-off is the **syntactic density**. With power tools, every motion is deliberate. With Perl, it's more like carving with your thumbnail: fast and fluid, but you need to know where your fingers are.

Still -- for the right job, at the right moment -- that familiarity and speed are hard to beat.
