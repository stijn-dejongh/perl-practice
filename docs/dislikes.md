# Stuff I dislike

Overview of the things I dislike about Perl, and (hopefully) how I plan to work around them or change my mindset. The goal is to revisit this in a while and see if I still agree with myself.

## Lack of Opinionatedness

Perl is a language that allows for a lot of freedom in how you write your code. This can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it allows for creativity and flexibility, but on the other hand, it can lead to messy and unstructured code. Being unfamiliar with the language, it was tricky to find a good starting point. I ended up using the [Modern Perl](https://pragprog.com/titles/swperl/modern-perl-fourth-edition/) book as a reference, to immerse myself in the way a "real perl programmer" thinks. I think this is something that will improve with time and experience, but it's definitely a hurdle for newcomers.

## Lack of Modern Tooling

Discovering Perl::Critic and Perl::Tidy helped a lot, but I still feel like the tooling around Perl is a bit behind the times. I am mostly missing the kind of IDE support that I get in other languages, like Java, TypeScript or Python. Especially when it comes to refactoring tools such as __"extract method/variable"__.
